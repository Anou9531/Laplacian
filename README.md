# Learn-Graph-Laplacian
This is an implementation of the paper  Learning Laplacian Matrix in Smooth Graph Signal Representations 

https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.7842.pdf

# Tests
- Precision, Recall, F-measure are comparable to those mentioned in the paper for both ER graph and Gaussian RBF. For BA graph, it is less.
- No parameters are changed for Gaussian RBF. For ER the threshold is slightly increased.
